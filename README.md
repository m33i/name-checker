# github name checker

check availability of Github usernames by specific pattern mixing letters or numbers

you can choose what structure to use/look for or try with a random generated username 

> todo:
- [x] implement find by character structure (thanks [@drtey](https://www.github.com/drtey) for collab) 
- [x] use regex lib for the random generated usernames and variables in structure search
- [ ] github allows single hyphens in between characters, should be added to default regex gen. and structure search
